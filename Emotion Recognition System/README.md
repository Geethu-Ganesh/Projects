# EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM
Emotion Recognition System is a technology that involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify and analyze human emotions. The primary goal is to develop systems capable of understanding and interpreting emotions expressed through various mediums such as facial expressions, speech, text, or physiological signals.
Emotion Recognition Systems find applications in diverse fields such as human-computer interaction, customer feedback analysis, sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, and robotics.

### Steps Involved
- Analyzing facial features, such as the movement of muscles and changes in expressions, to determine emotions.
- Gathering datasets that include labeled examples of emotions across different modalities (e.g., facial images, audio recordings, or text).
- Implementing the trained model in a real-time environment, allowing it to analyze incoming data streams (e.g., live video feeds, audio recordings) and provide instantaneous emotion predictions.
